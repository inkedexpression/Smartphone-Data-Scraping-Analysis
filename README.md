ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow

Web Scraping:

Extracted smartphone data from Smartprix using Selenium.

Collected information such as brand, model, price, RAM, storage, battery, processor, and ratings.

Data Cleaning:

Removed duplicate entries and missing values.

Standardized numerical values (e.g., converting price and storage formats).

Reduced dataset from 1,200 entries to 981 after cleaning.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified top smartphone brands based on count.

Analyzed price distribution and affordability trends.

Compared RAM, storage, and battery capacity across brands.

Visualized feature distributions using histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.
